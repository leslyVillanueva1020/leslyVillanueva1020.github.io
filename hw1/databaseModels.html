                    <h2>History of Database Models:</h2>
                    <p class="pInfo">The first widely used database was developed by IBM in the 1960s, called IMS (Information Management System). 
                    This was a hierarchical database, which means the data was organized in tree-like structures, but it lacked flexibility<a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/information-management-system?">[1]</a>. 
                    Then, in the 1970s, the relational model was developed by Edgar F. Codd. This model organized data into tables of rows and columns <a href="https://www.ibm.com/history/edgar-codd">[2]</a>. This is the foundation for SQL 
                    (Structured Query Language), also made by IBM, as it is a tool that interacts with relational models through commands to insert rows, create tables, 
                    run queries, etc <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">[3]</a>. As time went on and the internet grew, so did the data, creating new approaches to handling data, such as NoSQL databases. Databases 
                    and the models have changed to fit different needs, so understanding the models will help you understand why certain databases are chosen for specific 
                    applications.

                                <h3>Hierarchical Database</h3>
                                <p class="pInfo">The image above gives an idea of how a Hierarchical Database stores data, which is through parent nodes linked to child nodes. 
                                    Parents can have multiple child nodes, but child nodes only have one parent. This model was used to manage inventory and billing for NASA's 
                                    Apollo space program. However, this model became unpopular as data grew more complex because of the rigid tree structure, the difficulty of 
                                    updating, and the difficulty of querying. <br>

                                <h3>Relational Database</h3>
                                <p class="pInfo">A relational Database stores data into tables made up of rows and columns. The data can be stored on multiple tables and joined 
                                    together. These tables are defined using primary keys (unique identifiers) and foreign keys (links to keys in other tables). Here in the image, 
                                    we can see that the primary keys in Students is ID, in Courses it's ID, and in StudentCourses, the primary key is a combination (StudentID, 
                                    CourseID). The foreign keys in StudentCourses would be the Student.ID since it references Students (ID) and Course.ID since it references 
                                    Courses (ID). SQL helps interaction with relational databases to add, update, and delete rows more easily. These types of databases are still 
                                    commonly used today by business and web systems because of their flexibility for structured data. <br> <br>

                                        NoSQL databases were created to handle situations where relational tables are too rigid, such as with big data (millions or billions of records), 
                                        unstructured data (JSON documents, logs, social media posts, etc), or rapidly changing data. The models come in different types, just like the 
                                        image shows:
                                    </p>

                                <ul>
                                        <li>Document databases like MongoDB store data in JSON-like documents.</li>
                                        <li>Graph databases like Neo4j focus on relationships, used for social networks or recommendation systems. These models are flexible, 
                                            scale easily, and work well with unstructured or massive amounts of data.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Key-Value stores like Redis pair a unique key with a value, which allows for fast and direct key access due to its simplicity.</li>
                                        <li>Column-oriented databases like Cassandra group data by columns instead of rows, making them great for big data.</li>
                                    </ul>
