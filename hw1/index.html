                    <h2>Introduction to Databases:</h2>
                    <p class="pInfo">A database, in simplest terms, is a collection of organized data. This data needs 
                        to be accessed quickly and managed easily. If you use an Excel sheet to store data, 
                        that's going to be a lot harder to manage, update, and share securely. Databases allow 
                        us to do the same but with more efficiency. If you think about it, data is constantly being 
                        stored from the messages you send on Instagram to the Google Docs file you created. Databases 
                        are used in everyday systems such as banking, social media, hospitals, etc.

                            <p>Databases store information in tables, rows, and columns making it quickly and easily retrievable. Normalization, indexing, and compression
                                redundancy are used to improve performance. Flat files or spreadsheets will usually repeat the same information without normalization to separate
                                data. This is how databases improve efficiency and time. <br>

                            <p>Data integreity ensures that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent through the websites existence. Databases help ensure this through
                                rules defined such as entity integrity which ensures that data isn't recorded multiple times or that no null enteries are submitted. Other rules
                                such as referential and domain integrity which maintain the user's trust in the company's data integrity. <br>

                            <p>Quick searches, filters, updates to data, and analysis is possible through databases that use query languages like SQL. The features provided with
                                query languages such as indexes, limit result set, and permissions make data retriving fast, controlled, and secure. This can help with tracking stock levels, 
                                gain insight on information such as, low-stock items or in generating reports. <br>

                    <h3>Architectural Tiers of Databases:</h3>
                    <p class="pInfo">When it comes to databases, there are different architectural tiers to databases which each have their advantages and disadvanatges.<br><br>
                        <strong>First Tier:</strong> This is a database and an application hosted on a single server. 
                        This is easy to set up, but not secure since the application and database communicate directly on the same server. If someone gets access to the server, they
                        have access to the data and the application. <br> <br>
                        <strong>Second Tier: </strong>A database that can support multiple applications running from it. There is a Client layer which contains tha application
                        and a Server that contains the database. The database has its own dedicated server, but it still interacts directly with the client so 
                        the system is still vulnerable to data leaks or attacks. <br> <br>
                        <strong>Third Tier: </strong>A database, a server layer, and then the client layer (applications). This is the most common 
                        because it provides stronger security as there is no direct communication to the database from the client. With this tier there is increased scalability 
                        which means each tier can be scaled independently, and improved reliability. If one tier has an outage, it doesn't affect the working tiers. Since you can 
                        develop each of these tiers separate from other tiers, it speeds up the time it would take to develop the overall database architecture.
